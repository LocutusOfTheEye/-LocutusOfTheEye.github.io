    <p>This ByteWeight calculator converts bytes to physical weights. It was inspired by <a href="https://thatxliner.github.io/blog/posts/how-to-convert-bytes-to-grams/" target="_blank">ThatXliner's Blog post</a>, in which they created a "How to Convert Bytes to Grams" formula, which we'll refer to as Bytes to MLA Grams or B2MLA for short. This is only for the context of the discussions below.</p>
	<p>I created this calculator to improve upon the specifications and therefore the algorithm within ThatXliner's blog post. This quickly became proof that Attention Deficit Disorder is a major concern in today's society. In fact, I almost didn't finish the calculator before moving on to something else, leaving it half done. But it appears I have finished this just before getting bored and have substancially improve upon the original specifications for creating a perfectly feasible bytes to weight conversion method. And with this method, a calculator to allow conversions to grams, kilograms, ounces, and pounds.</p>
	<p>I would like to thank ThatXliner and anonymous for triggering my ADD and setting me down a rabbit hole I probably should have avoided to begin with.</p>
	<p>While I am sure the author is aware that MLA formatting is super expensive to convert to a physical weight, I understand the academic purpose or nostalgia if you will by doing such. But my purpose of letting my ADD get the better of me is only to improve upon the physical weight, storage requirements and hypothetical impact to the environment by producing a more efficient specifications and formula.</p>
	<p>To convert bytes to text on paper, they initially utilized MLA formatting and what they called "normal printer paper" with a weight density of 70-100 GSM (grams per square meter) or an average of 85 GSM. With the utilization of MLA format they automatically inherit a 12 point Times New Roman font. It is obvious that this simply makes little sense, much like any of this. However, for the sake of this experiment, we will pretend there is a real world application for these efforts.</p>
	<p>My specifications allow for a more eco-friendly and space-saving approach. By reducing the margins from 1 inch to 0.17" and using 16 lb bond paper, we can achieve a physical footprint of 60.2 vs 85 GSM and 3.63 vs 5.1274091 grams per sheet. In our experiments, we discovered that using a 6-point font size and Arial as the font made the most sense and gave us 45,320 characters per page instead of 3,220 characters.</p>

	</a>
    </div>
	<br>
	<p>As you can imagine, this will substantially reduce the physical expense in terms of weight, carbon footprint, and storage requirements. Hence, we named this new conversion format "Bytes to Eco-Compact Grams" or B2EG. As you can imagine, I have yet to submit this concept or name to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In either case, it helps mostly for identification below.</p>
    <p>This new format allows us to fit 45,320 characters per page, a significant increase from the previous 3,220 characters.</p>

    <h2>Results Comparison (B2MLA vs B2EG)</h2>
    <p>The ratio of grams to bytes (R) for the B2EG method is calculated by dividing the weight of the paper (G) by the amount of data it can hold (B). The formula would be as follows:
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image4.png" alt="Grams-to-bytes ratio">
    </div>

	Based on the previously explained and printer proven methods, we now know that 45,320 characters * 1 byte = 45,320 bytes can fit onto a sheet of 3.63 gram B2EG printed paper.</p>
    <p>The grams-to-bytes ratio can be visualized as shown as:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="image5.png" alt="B2EG Grams-to-bytes ratio">
    </div>
	<p>This means that with the B2EG formula, each byte of data corresponds to approximately 8.01 × 10<sup>-5</sup> grams per byte, meaning that each byte of data corresponds to around 8.01 × 10<sup>-5</sup> grams of paper.
	<br>
	<p>Similarly, for the B2MLA method, the ratio of grams to byte (R') is calculated by dividing the weight of the paper (G') by the amount of data it can hold (B'):<p>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image6.png" alt="Grams-to-bytes ratio B2MLA">
    </div>
	<p>Substituting the B2MLA values into this equation, we get:</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image7.png" alt="Grams-to-bytes ratio B2MLA filled">
    </div>
	<p>This means that with the B2MLA method, each byte of data corresponds to approximately 1.59 × 10<sup>-3</sup> grams of paper. The B2EG formula is obviously far more efficient than the B2MLA formula, as it requires less paper (in grams) to store each byte of data. But you may ask, "how much though?" Since you're still reading this, I guess you are also interested in the pain of ADD rabbit holes, so I will not disappoint you.</p>
	<p>We can define the efficiency of these methods as the amount of data (in bytes) that can be stored per gram of paper. Let's denote the efficiency as E.</p>
	<p>For the B2EG method, the efficiency E<sub>B2EG</sub> is given by:
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image8.png" alt="B2EG efficiency">
    </div>
	<p>Substituting the B2EG values into this equation, we get:</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image9.png" alt="B2EG efficiency filled">
    </div>
	<p>This means that with the B2EG method, each gram of paper can hold approximately 12,475.21 bytes of data.</p>
	<p>Similarly, for the B2MLA method, the efficiency E<sub>B2MLA</sub> is given by:</P>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image10.png" alt="B2MLA efficiency">
    </div>
	<p>Substituting the B2MLA values into this equation, we get:</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image11.png" alt="B2MLA efficiency filled">
    </div>
	<p>This means that the B2MLA method, each gram of paper can hold approximately 628.02 bytes of data.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, the B2EG method is far more efficient than the B2MLA method, as it can store more data (in bytes) per gram of paper. The ratio of the efficiencies of the B2EG method to the B2MLA method is:</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="image12.png" alt="B2EG vs B2MLA efficiency compared">
    </div>
	<p>This means that the B2EG method is approximately 19.86 times more efficient than the B2MLA method.</p>

	<p>Using the improved B2EG method, the total weight of all these libraries is approximately 17.3817 grams. This is approximately equivalent to the weight of 3.5 nickels (since one nickel weighs 5 grams). This can be compared to the weight of the B2MLA method of 345.03 grams, the equivilent of 69 nickels or roughly the weight of a can of soup.</p>

	<h2>Testing weight claims:</h2>
    <p>PrismJS - Like <a href="https://thatxliner.github.io/blog/posts/how-to-convert-bytes-to-grams/" target="_blank">ThatXliner's Blog post</a> we will use version 1.29.0, which claims to be "as light as a feather", actually weighs approximately 325.42836 grams in B2EG and 6457.43 grams in B2MLA. In both cases, this is significantly heavier than a feather, which weighs about 0.0082 grams according to whatthingsweigh.com. The actual weight of PrismJS when using the more efficient B2EG can be compared to 11,707,317 feathers. A far cry from their claims.</p>
    <p>Goober - Also like <a href="https://thatxliner.github.io/blog/posts/how-to-convert-bytes-to-grams/" target="_blank">ThatXliner's Blog post</a>, we will use version 2.1.13, which claims to be "at the cost of peanuts", actually weighs approximately 96.194012 grams in B2EG and 1909.47 grams in B2MLA. Given that a peanut weighs about 0.8 grams according to weightschool.com, Goober is lighter than a single peanut and is equivalent to 120,242.5 peanuts if using B2EG. I'd say they over promise on this one.</p>
